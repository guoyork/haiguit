But the court decided otherwise, and Kirill walked free. \n\nBill decided to hide all the evidence of the new crime so that Kirill could be punished for the murder. \n\n (Pay attention to the difference between “believe” and “know” when answering the questions)\n\n --- \n This is a common plot for literature and movies. \n\nIn Claude Chabrol’s Inspector Lavardin, an innocent man is accused, but Lavardin keeps silent although he knows that he’s innocent in this murder case, since the accused has committed other crimes that Lavardin can’t prove. \n\n “The Judge and his Executioner” by Friedrich Durrenmatt has the same plot.",

At the same time, the flight speed reached 150 km/h. So, the pilots wore thick leather clothes with maximum wind resistance.\nAt that time, there were no long-range detection systems. To be the first to detect the enemy, the pilot had to turn his head round at least every 20 seconds. The cases are known when pilots rubbed their necks to blood.\nThat’s how the pilots got white silk scarves for flights. Silk is a very smooth and at the same time dense fabric. It served both as protection from the headwind and as a smooth layer between the skin and the collar.",

Houdini barely stopped him, “Wait, I need to get ready.” Then, he strained his abs, “You can strike now.” The student struck a couple times and felt Houdini’s iron abs. \nHarry ignored the increasing stomach ache for a few days. The illusionist fell right on stage during a performance in Detroit and was taken to the hospital. Houdini was diagnosed with a burst appendix, which caused peritonitis. Doctors predicted speedy death, but the illusionist survived a few days, which was pretty long in his situation. Harry Houdini died, his body was taken to New York and buried in a bronze box that he used for his tricks.\nHarry Houdini is an American illusionist, philanthropist, and actor.

Stories of beard-pulling in battles were myth rather than history. Plutarch and later historians misunderstood the order because they neglected the most relevant fact, namely that Alexander had dared to do what no self-respecting Greek leader had ever done before: shave his face, likening himself to the demigod Heracles, rendered in painting and sculpture in the immortal splendor of youthful, beardless nudity. Alexander wished above all, as he told his generals before the battle, that each man would see himself as a crucial part of the mission. They would certainly see this more clearly if each of them looked more like their heroic commander.",
